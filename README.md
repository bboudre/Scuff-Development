## Current Project Status [May 2023]
Due to the time given for the project, the Arduino, web server, and application run independently of each other. 

### Working Functionality 
    Aggie Park
* The application can show the user's location, have the user input a destination, and map a route from location to destination. 
* The campus map is connected to the app of NMSU. 
* Settings is set to change user's permit type.

### Future Work 
    Aggie Park 
* Switch from a local search on MapKit to a custom annotation search. 
    * database for campus buildings' closest parking lots based on permit type
* Map parking lot annotations and reroute polyline to chosen parking lot 
* Update real-time for duration to get from user location to destination

Much work/research and time are required for further development of the app. 

We will continue to work on this app outside of the initial time given, to hopefully succeed in all functional components working.
